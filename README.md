# kotlin-slimefun-template

This is a template for [Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4) addons written in Kotlin. 
It uses my library [sf4k](https://github.com/Seggan/sf4k) to make the development process easier.
It also uses the Paper plugin system, which is experimental, but is rather stable already.

## How to use this template
Replace all instances of `YOURNAME` with your Github name, and `YOURADDON` with your addon's name. 
Then, you can start developing your addon.
